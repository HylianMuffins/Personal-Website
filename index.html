        <p>
          I was born in Calgary, AB in 2003 as the second oldest of 10 children.
          At the age of 11, I stumbled upon the JavaScript coding course on Khan
          Academy. This was my first introduction to code, and I knew I wanted
          to continue learning as much as I could.
        </p>
        <p>
          In grade 9, I started attending St. John Choir Schola. I worked
          diligently throughout high school and graduated at the top of my class
          as Valedictorian.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2021, I was accepted into the Schulich School of Engineering at the
          UofC and have been pursuing a degree in Software Engineering ever
          since.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a major in Software Engineering and a minor in Mechatronics
          Engineering, I plan on leading the world of tech and software forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always been impelled by the desire for quality. So when I
          imagine the future, I see a community of people working to raise the
          standard of quality in the industry, ultimately improving the quality
          of life for all who rely upon their contributions.

          Although I haven't worked in the Software Industry (Yet!), I still
          have plenty of experience working professionaly in solo work, as a
          team member, and as a leader.

          <h1>Audio/Visual Technician and Team Lead</h1>
          <p>
            I am currently working as an AV tech. I work with live audio mixing
            systems and video presentation software to live stream services and
            special events such as weddings and funerals.

            As a head technician, I lead and supervise a group of other

          <h1>Workshop Manager and Forklift Operator</h1>
          <p>
            This summer I worked as the sole shop technician at the
            manufacturing workshop for a local business. There I manufactured
            and shipped out Large shelter tents to Pipeline operations all over
            North America.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working alone in a fast paced environment taught me self reliance
            and decision making, as well as a sense of personal responsibility
            and time management.
